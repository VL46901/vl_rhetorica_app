# VL RHETORICA App

This repository contains a **minimal, functional web application** and supporting documentation for the VL RHETORICA project.  The goal of the project is to provide a structured roadmap and comprehensive resources for turning a rhetoric‑focused concept into a full business venture.

## What’s Included

- **Interactive Roadmap App** – A React application using Vite and Tailwind CSS.  It organises tasks across three phases, records risks, tracks asset protection actions and lists key deliverables.
- **Business Model** – A markdown document (`docs/BusinessModel.md`) outlining the nine components of a business model canvas with guidance on customer segments, value propositions, revenue streams and more.
- **Manifesto** – A manifesto (`docs/Manifesto.md`) articulating VL RHETORICA’s core values, story and purpose using strategies like starting with core values and telling a story to connect emotionally.
- **Style Guide** – A style guide (`docs/StyleGuide.md`) defining the brand story, logo guidelines, colour palette, typography, imagery, tone of voice and editorial rules.
- **Application Documentation** – A user guide (`docs/Documentation.md`) describing the app’s features, installation steps and ways to extend it.
